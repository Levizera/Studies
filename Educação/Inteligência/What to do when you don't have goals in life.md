1. Start cleaning your room and transforming the caos that it is and putting things on order. 
2. Ask yourself what you can do today to have a better tomorrow, or at least don't let things fall behind. 
	- Ask yourself what of the things around you are asking for a fixing, and start working  on it. 
	- Do little things, go step by step.

3. Organizing things is kinda a meditation, because you're priting your digitals on things.
